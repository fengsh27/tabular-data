    "Pregnancy stage, is text, What pregnancy stages of patients mentioned in the paper, like 'postpartum', 'before pregnancy', '1st trimester' and so on. If not mentioned, please label as 'N/A',.\n "
    "Subject N,  the number of subjects that correspond to the specific parameter. .\n "
    "Parameter type, is text, the type of parameter, like 'concentration after the first dose', 'concentration after the second dose', 'clearance', 'Total area under curve' and so on..\n "
    "Value, is a number, the value of parameter.\n "
    "Unit, the unit of the value.\n "

    "Lower limit, is a number, the lower bounds of the interval.\n "
    "High limit, is a number, the higher bounds of the interval.\n "
    "P value, The p-value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes the likelihood of a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true; varies depending on the study, and therefore it may not always be reported."

    "Outcomes is A measure(s) of interest that is correlated with the exposure and is reported as the primary or secondary outcome(s) in the PE papers. These could be pregnancy, obstetric or birth related outcomes that are associated with the drug or exposure of interest. They could also include general disease or health conditions, health related events, or deaths..\n "
