If not mentioned, please label as 'N/A',\nSN: Subject N, is the number of subjects that correspond to the specific parameter.\nPT: Parameter type, is the type of parameter, like 'concentration after the first dose', 'concentration after the second dose', 'clearance', 'Total area under curve' and so on.\nV: Value, is the value of parameter, not a range.\nU: Unit, is the unit of the value\nSS: Summary statistics, is the statistics method to summary the data, like 'mean', 'median', etc.\nVV: Variation value, is the number (not a range) that corresponds to the specific variation.\nVT: Variation type, is the variability measure (describes how spread out the data is) associated with the specific parameter, e.g., standard deviation (SD), CV%.\nIT: Interval type, specifies the type of interval that is being used to describe uncertainty or variability around a measure or estimate, infer it from the table, like '95% CI'.\nLL: Lower limit, is the lower bounds of the interval\nHL: High limit, is the higher bounds of the interval\nPV: P value, is a number calculated from a statistical test, that describes the likelihood of a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true; varies depending on the study, and therefore it may not always be reported.\nPlease Notes:\n1. Only output table in compact json format without any other characters, no space, no newline, no triple backticks ``` and no 'json'.\n2. If the information that is not provided, please leave it with empty string.\n3. The fields 'Analyte' (Ana), 'Specimen' (Sp), and 'Population' (Pop) must always be filled. If not explicitly mentioned in the source, they must be inferred based on other sections of the table and its caption. Do not leave these fields empty.\n4. The fields 'Variation value' (VV) and 'Variation type' (VT) are limited to explicitly listed values in the table and must not be derived from other numbers (e.g., confidence intervals, standard deviation, etc.). If not provided, leave it blank.\n5. The fields 'Value' (V), 'Variation value' (VV) must be a value instead of a range. If a range is provided, please extract the lower and upper bounds and put them into 'Lower limit' (LL) and 'High limit' (HL), respectively.\n6. Ensure all rows are extracted with every possible SN value, retrieving SN from other relevant tables if not explicitly stated in TABLE_SECTION_NAME, and focus only on TABLE_SECTION_NAME.\n",
