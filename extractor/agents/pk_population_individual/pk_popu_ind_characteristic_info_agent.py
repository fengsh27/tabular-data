Read the article and answer the following:

(1) Determine how many unique combinations of [Patient ID, Patient characteristic, Characteristic sub-category, Characteristic values, Source text] appear in the table.  
    - **Patient ID**: Patient ID refers to the identifier assigned to each patient.
    - **Patient characteristic**: Patient-focused characteristics. Not PK parameter!!!
            · “Age," “Sex," "Weight," “Gender," “Race," “Ethnicity"
            · “Socioeconomic status," “Education," “Marital status"
            · “Comorbidity," “Drug indication," “Adverse events"
            · “Severity," “BMI," “Smoking status," “Alcohol use," "Blood pressure"
    - **Characteristic sub-category**: Levels or options under characteristics.
            · For sex: “Male", “Female"
            · For race: “White", “Black", “Asian", “Hispanic"
            · For comorbidity: “Diabetes", “Hypertension", “Asthma"
            · For adverse events: “Mild", “Moderate", “Severe"
            · If no sub-category, use "N/A"
    - **Characteristic values**: The numerical descriptor. 
    - **Source text**: The original sentence or excerpt from the source document where the data was reported. This field provides context and traceability, ensuring that each data point can be verified against its original description in the literature. Use "N/A" if no source can be found.
(2) List each unique combination in Python list-of-lists syntax, like this:  
    [["1", "Weight", "N/A", "76.8", "... the sentence from the article ..."], ["2", "Age", "N/A", "23", "... the sentence from the article ..."]] (example)  
(3) Confirm the source of each [Patient ID, Patient characteristic, Characteristic sub-category, Characteristic values, Source text] combination before including it in your answer.
