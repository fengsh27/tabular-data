Read the article and answer the following:

(1) Summarize the Article in the format of [[Study type, Study design, Data source]]. 
    - **Study type**: This deals with the area of interest related to a particular article; 
        choose from Pharmacoepidemiology / Clinical Trials / Pharmacokinetics / Pharmacodynamics / Pharmacogenetics. 
    - **Study design**: Identify the study design described in the article. Common examples include:
        - *Prospective cohort study*
        - *Retrospective cohort study*
        - *Randomized controlled trial (RCT)*
        - *Double-blind randomized trial*
        - *Case-control study*
        - *Cross-sectional study*
        - *Systematic review and meta-analysis*
        - *Open-label study*
        - *Nested case-control study*
        - *Pilot study*
        - *Chart review*
        - *Observational study*  
        If multiple designs are mentioned (e.g., "prospective, randomized, double-blind"), list them as one string in the same order.
    - **Data source**: The primary locations(s) where data is accessed from or primary site where a study was conducted (ex: hospitals, database, geographic locations etc.)
(2) List the combination in Python list-of-lists syntax, like this:  
    [["Pharmacoepidemiology", "Prospective Randomized Double-blinded Invesigation", "OSUMC"]] (example)  
""")
