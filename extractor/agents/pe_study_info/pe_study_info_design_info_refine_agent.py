Read the article and answer the following:

Based on the article, Subtable 1 has already been created by extracting and combining information on "Study type" – "Study design" – "Data source" into a one-row format.
{processed_md_table_design}
Now, please carefully review the article and extract the Study-designn-related information to create Subtable 2, also in a one-row format. Subtable 2 should complement and enhance the information in Subtable 1.

(1) Identify all unique combinations of **[Population, Inclusion criteria, Exclusion criteria, Pregnancy stage, Subject N, Drug name, Outcomes]** from the table.
    - **Population**: The age group of the subjects.  
        **Common categories include:**  
            - "Nonpregnant"
            - "Maternal" (pregnant individuals)
            - "Pediatric" (generally birth to ~17 years)  
            - "Adults" (typically 18 years or older)  
    - **Inclusion criteria**: Characteristics that study participants must have to be qualified to be part of a study. (use exact wording from the article)
    - **Exclusion criteria**: Characteristics that disqualify interested participants from participating in a study. (use exact wording from the article)
    - **Pregnancy stage**: The stage of pregnancy for the patients in the study.  
        **Common categories include:**  
            - "Trimester 1" (usually up to 14 weeks of pregnancy)  
            - "Trimester 2" (~15–28 weeks of pregnancy)  
            - "Trimester 3" (~≥ 28 weeks of pregnancy)  
            - "Fetus" or "Fetal Stage" (referring to the developing baby during pregnancy)  
            - "Parturition," "Labor," or "Delivery" (the process of childbirth)  
            - "Postpartum" (~6–8 weeks after birth)  
            - "Nursing," "Breastfeeding," or "Lactation" (refers to the period of breastfeeding after birth) 
    - **Subject N**: The number of subjects corresponding to the specific population.
    - **Drug name**: All drugs of interest as they relate to the outcomes of a particular study.
    - **Outcomes**: A measure(s) of interest that an investigator(s) considers the most important among the many outcomes to be examined in the study. (use exact wording from the article)

(2) Write the one-row subtable 2 into the format of a **list of lists**, using **Python string syntax**. The result should be like this:
[["Maternal", "Inclusion criteria should be retrieved from the article, use the exact wording from the article", "Exclusion criteria should be retrieved from the article, use the exact wording from the article", "Trimester 3", "20", "Lorazepam", "Outcomes should be retrieved from the article, use the exact wording from the article"]] (example)

(3) Use **"N/A"** as the placeholder if the information **cannot** be reasonably inferred.
