Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[70]]

The two tables have significant differences:

1. Table 2 is missing many rows compared to Table 1. Table 1 has 110 rows while Table 2 only has 105 rows. The missing rows reduce the similarity score significantly.

2. The Characteristic/risk factor column in Table 2 contains different information than in Table 1. Table 2 has entries like "Failure (nonresponders)", "Success MBP-OP at", "Delayed failure", etc. which are not present in Table 1. This indicates the data is not mapped to the correct columns.

3. The Statistic column in Table 2 contains entries like "Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements" and "Fisher's exact test" which are not summary statistics. Based on the column definition, the Statistic column should not contain this type of information. 

4. Table 2 is missing the % symbol in the Value column for percentage values.

5. Table 2 has many rows where the Interval low and Interval high columns contain inequality symbols like < and >, while Table 1 does not use inequality symbols in these columns.

6. Table 2 uses the term "beats per min" in the Unit column while Table 1 uses "Beats per min". While these refer to the same unit, the inconsistency reduces the similarity score slightly.

In summary, while the two tables contain some overlapping information, the numerous differences in data mapping, missing rows, and inconsistencies in following the column definitions result in a similarity score of 70 out of 100. The tables would need significant reformatting and cleanup to be considered highly similar.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[70]]

The two tables have a moderate level of similarity, with some key differences:

1. Table 2 is missing the "NA" values present in the Characteristic/risk factor column of Table 1. This makes it harder to directly compare rows between the tables.

2. Table 2 contains additional rows at the beginning with age, weight, RACHS-1 score, baseline creatinine, baseline SAP, CPB time, cross-clamp time, and DHCA time data that are not present in Table 1. 

3. The exposure groups are labeled slightly differently between the tables ("Fenoldopam" vs "Patients received fenoldopam", "Control" vs "Patients in control group").

4. Table 2 contains the unit "None" for the inotropic score, while Table 1 uses "Number". 

5. The p-values are missing for many rows in Table 1 but are present for all rows in Table 2.

6. The order of the outcome measures differs between the tables.

However, the core data on hemodynamic parameters and electrolyte levels is quite consistent between the two tables when comparing the matching Fenoldopam and Control groups. The values, units, and variability measures align well.

In summary, while there are some structural and labeling differences, the key clinical data is moderately similar between the two tables. The additional baseline data in Table 2 provides useful context not available in Table 1. But the missing "NA" labels and ordering differences reduce the overall similarity to a score of 70 out of 100.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing the "Variability statistic", "Variability value", "Interval type", "Interval low", and "Interval high" columns compared to Table 1.
2. Table 2 has additional rows for p-values, which are not present in Table 1.
3. The "Characteristic/risk factor" and "Exposure" columns in Table 2 are merged into the "Outcomes" column.
4. The data in Table 2 is not well-organized according to the column definitions. For example, the "Value" column contains both frequency and percentage values.
5. Table 2 uses abbreviations for drug names (CBZ, VPA, LEV), while Table 1 uses full names (Levetiracetam, Valproate).
6. The outcomes in Table 2 are not as detailed as in Table 1, e.g., "Patients with complete disappearance of hypsarrhythmia" vs. "EEG response - complete disappearance".
7. The p-values in Table 2 are in a separate row, while in Table 1, they are in the same row as the corresponding data.

Similarities:
1. Both tables contain information about seizure response and EEG response to different drugs in children with rolandic epilepsy.
2. The drugs mentioned in both tables are the same (Levetiracetam, Valproate, Carbamazepine).
3. The outcomes measured (seizure-free, 50% reduction of seizures, total responder, EEG response, duration of response) are similar in both tables.
4. The "Statistic", "Value", and "Unit" columns are present in both tables.

Considering the significant differences in the structure, organization, and level of detail between the two tables, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[35]]

The score is relatively low due to the missing columns, inconsistent data placement, and lack of detailed outcomes in Table 2 compared to Table 1.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The tables have some overlap in the characteristics and outcomes reported, but there are also significant differences:

Similarities:
- Both tables report on patients receiving methylprednisolone vs placebo
- Several of the same outcomes are reported including STAT mortality risk categories, CPB duration, aortic cross clamp duration, use of DHCA, DHCA duration, and use of modified ultrafiltration
- The values, units, and variability statistics align for the overlapping outcomes

Differences: 
- Table 2 contains many additional patient characteristics not found in Table 1, such as gestational age, sex, race, ethnicity, age at surgery, weight at surgery, and more granular procedure/diagnosis categories
- Table 1 is missing several of the outcomes reported in Table 2
- The row order and total number of rows differs significantly between the tables
- Table 2 reports p-values for comparisons between the methylprednisolone and placebo groups for some outcomes, while Table 1 only reports them sporadically
- Some terminology differs, e.g. "USE of DHCA" in Table 1 vs "Use of DHCA" in Table 2, "DCHA duration" vs "DHCA duration"

Given the significant differences in the number of characteristics and outcomes reported, as well as the inconsistencies in reporting p-values and some terminology, I would assess the overall similarity of these tables as:

[[55]]

The tables report on the same groups and share some key outcomes, but differ substantially in scope and granularity. Aligning the shared elements requires carefully mapping outcomes between the two tables.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The tables have a high degree of overlap in the parameters reported, including blood loss, need for uterotonic agents, hemoglobin levels, blood pressure, pulse rate, and drug side effects. The exposures (tranexamic acid and control) and units are consistent between the tables.

However, there are several key differences:

1. Table 2 is missing rows for abortion, duration of third stage of labor, BP/PR/Hb before delivery that are present in Table 1. 

2. Table 2 reports some outcomes differently, such as "Drug side effect during the first 24 h No" instead of "No Drug side effect during the first 24 h". The side effects are also formatted differently with line breaks.

3. The statistics column in Table 2 uses formats like "mean±SD" and "n (%)" which don't match the "mean" and "Frequency" used in Table 1. 

4. Table 2 is missing p-values for many rows that are present in Table 1.

5. Some of the values are formatted differently between the tables, like "-93.30%" vs "93.3".

6. Table 2 appears to have the exposure groups in separate rows for each outcome, while Table 1 keeps them in the exposure column.

Given the high overlap in parameters but differences in formatting and some missing data, I would assess the similarity as:

[[70]]

The tables report mostly the same information but have enough structural and formatting differences to not be considered highly similar. Standardizing the formatting and ensuring all parameters are present in both tables would increase the similarity score.

Here are the key differences between the two tables:

1. Table 1 focuses specifically on quetiapine exposure and its associated outcomes, while Table 2 covers a broader range of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone) and their effects on infants exposed through breastfeeding.

2. Table 1 reports the frequency of specific outcomes (exposed while breastfeeding, delay in motor and mental milestones) in terms of the number of patients affected. In contrast, Table 2 provides both the frequency and percentage of infants experiencing various side effects (rash, sedation, diarrhea, constipation, excessive cry, jitteriness).

3. Table 2 includes additional information on the effects of olanzapine and risperidone exposure on infant weight, height, and DASII scores, which is not present in Table 1.

4. The structure and formatting of the two tables differ significantly. Table 1 has a more concise structure with fewer rows and columns, while Table 2 has a more extensive layout with multiple rows for each outcome and additional columns for interval type, interval low, and interval high values.

5. Table 2 has several rows with missing or incomplete data (e.g., rows 12-23), which reduces the overall similarity between the two tables.

Considering these differences and the provided guidelines, the similarity score between Table 1 and Table 2 is:

[[30]]

The low similarity score is primarily due to the significant differences in the scope of the exposures and outcomes reported, the structure and formatting of the tables, and the presence of missing or incomplete data in Table 2.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The tables have some overlap in the "Progression risk factor analysis for spherical equivalent more than − 0.50 diopters" section, but there are significant differences overall:

- Table 1 contains data on changes in ophthalmic parameters after 1 year of atropine 0.01% treatment, which is completely absent from Table 2. This makes up the majority of Table 1.

- Table 2 contains additional risk factor data not present in Table 1, such as age, gender, and iris color. 

- The risk factor odds ratios common between the tables (previous year progression, spherical equivalent, axial length, anterior chamber, pupil size) have the same values. However, Table 2 contains an additional "Residual" variability statistic for each that is not present in Table 1.

- Table 1 is missing the "Residual" variability statistic data present in Table 2. Conversely, Table 2 is missing all the baseline, 12-month, and change data that makes up most of Table 1.

- The column labels are the same between the tables. The data is mapped to the correct columns in both.

In summary, while there is a small amount of overlapping data between the risk factor odds ratios, the two tables cover substantially different information overall. Table 1 focuses mainly on atropine treatment outcomes, while Table 2 focuses on additional progression risk factors. Based on the large amount of non-overlapping data and the presence/absence of certain statistics between the tables, I would assess the similarity as:

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing many of the characteristics/risk factors and outcomes present in Table 1, such as antenatal steroid use, cesarean section, maternal hypertension, gestational diabetes, Apgar scores, RDS surfactant use, patent ductus arteriosus treatment, and many others. This significantly reduces the similarity score.

2. Table 2 uses different terminology for some outcomes compared to Table 1. For example, "Thinning of the corpus callosum" vs "Tinning of the corpus callosum", and "dilated lateral ventricles" vs "Dilated lateral ventricles". 

3. The summary statistics used are different between the tables. Table 1 primarily uses medians and percentages, while Table 2 uses "None" for many of the summary statistic cells.

4. The variation statistics are different. Table 1 uses interquartile ranges, while Table 2 uses ranges.

5. Some data in Table 2 seems to be in the wrong columns. For example, rows 55-94 have data in the "Value" column that looks like it should be in the "Interval low" and "Interval high" columns based on the header definitions.

Similarities:
1. Both tables are comparing outcomes based on exposure to morphine in very preterm infants.

2. Many of the brain abnormality outcomes are the same between the tables, such as focal signal abnormality, thinning of the corpus callosum, dilated lateral ventricles, volume reduction, etc.

3. The exposure groups (morphine exposure vs no exposure) are the same.

4. The statistics used (adjusted relative risk, median, percent) are largely the same, although used inconsistently in Table 2.

Based on the significant differences in included characteristics/risk factors and outcomes, the inconsistencies in data entry in Table 2, and the differences in summary and variation statistics used, I would give these tables a similarity score of:

[[35]]

The tables are looking at a similar clinical question in a similar population, but the execution and completeness are quite different between the two tables, leading to a low similarity score when using Table 1 as the reference standard.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing the "Trachomatous inflammation - follicular prevalence" outcome that is present in Table 1. Instead, Table 2 contains demographic characteristics of the study population.
2. Table 2 does not have any data for the "Interval low", "Interval high", and "P value" columns that are present in Table 1.
3. The "Statistic" column in Table 2 contains "mean" values, while Table 1 has "Percent" and "Incidence rate ratio".
4. Table 2 has additional columns for "Variability statistic" and "Variability value" that are not present in Table 1.
5. The exposures and characteristics/risk factors are different between the two tables.

Similarities:
1. Both tables have data for the "Azithromycin" and "Placebo" exposure groups.
2. The "Unit" column is present in both tables, although it is not populated in Table 1.
3. Both tables have a "Value" column.

Based on the significant differences in the outcomes, statistics, and overall structure of the two tables, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[25]]

The tables have some overlap in the exposure groups and a few common columns, but the majority of the data and structure is different. Table 2 appears to be presenting baseline demographic characteristics of the study population, while Table 1 is focused on the trachoma prevalence outcomes at baseline and 24 months.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Similarity Score: [[50]]

Key Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing many of the exposures and outcomes present in Table 1, such as Apgar scores, cardiac massage at delivery, drugs for resuscitation, intubation at delivery, postnatal age at initiation of postnatal corticosteroid, duration of treatment, and respiratory support details.

2. Table 2 includes additional exposures and outcomes not present in Table 1, such as birth weight, male sex, total length of stay, total days of mechanical ventilation, days to extubation after PNC administered, survival to discharge, BPD status, treated retinopathy of prematurity, severe NEC, GI perforation, and brain injury on imaging.

3. The structure and formatting of the two tables are quite different. Table 1 has a consistent format with each row representing a specific exposure-outcome combination, while Table 2 has a more complex structure with multiple levels of exposures and outcomes.

4. Some of the data in Table 2 appears to be in the wrong columns based on the column definitions provided. For example, the "Interval type" column contains data that should be in the "Variability statistic" column (e.g., IQR).

5. Table 2 uses different terminology for some exposures and outcomes compared to Table 1 (e.g., "Postnatal steroids for BPD" vs. specific drug names like dexamethasone and hydrocortisone).

6. Table 2 includes data for different gestational age groups (<32 weeks and <27 weeks) that are not present in Table 1.

Given these significant differences in structure, content, and formatting, I have assigned a similarity score of 50 out of 100. The two tables cover some of the same exposures and outcomes related to postnatal corticosteroid use, but there are many discrepancies that limit their overall similarity.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

Similarity Score: [[65]]

Key Differences:
1. The extracted table is missing the "Exposure" column that is present in the baseline table. This significantly reduces the similarity score.

2. The extracted table has additional rows for "Total" values that are not present in the baseline table.

3. The extracted table is missing some of the specific outcomes present in the baseline table, such as "Delayed Failure" and "Total Treatment Failure" for the rate of MBP response.

4. The extracted table has additional rows breaking down cerebral ultrasound results by "Success" and "Failure", which are not present in the baseline table.

5. Some of the units in the extracted table do not match the units in the baseline table. For example, the baseline table uses "Number" for the frequency unit, while the extracted table uses "n".

6. The p-values are missing for many of the comparisons in the extracted table.

7. The ordering and grouping of the rows is different between the two tables, making direct comparison more difficult.

While there is significant overlap in the data presented, the missing "Exposure" column, additional and missing rows, and inconsistencies in units and p-value reporting lead to a moderately low similarity score of 65 out of 100. The extracted table would need substantial editing to more closely match the structure and content of the baseline table.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

The tables have a high degree of overlap in the parameters reported, including systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), inotropic score (IS), lactate levels, serum sodium (Na+), urine sodium, serum potassium (K+), and urine potassium levels. These are reported for the fenoldopam and control groups over 3 days.

Key differences:
- The extracted table includes additional baseline characteristics like age, weight, RACHS-1 score, baseline creatinine, baseline SAP, CPB time, cross-clamp time, and DHCA time that are not in the baseline table. 
- The extracted table uses the full terms like "interquartile range" and "range" in the Interval type column, while the baseline uses abbreviations like "IQR".
- Some p-values differ slightly between the tables, e.g. for lactate levels the extracted table shows 0.056 while baseline shows 5.60E-02.
- The extracted table is missing the "NA" values in the Characteristic/risk factor, Variability statistic and Variability value columns that are present in the baseline.

The data appears to be mapped to the correct columns in both tables based on the provided definitions. The content of each cell matches the expected column type.

Given the high overlap in parameters and appropriate data mapping, but considering the additional baseline factors in the extracted table and some missing "NA" values, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[85]]

The tables are largely the same in content, with the main difference being the extra baseline factors included in the extracted version.

Similarities:
- Both tables report outcomes related to seizure response, EEG response, and duration of response for children with rolandic epilepsy treated with levetiracetam (LEV), valproate (VPA), or carbamazepine (CBZ).
- The outcomes and exposures are generally aligned between the two tables.
- The statistics used (percent, frequency, mean) are consistent between the tables.

Differences:
- The extracted table includes data for CBZ, while the baseline table does not.
- The extracted table is missing the "EEG response - responder" row for LEV that is present in the baseline table.
- The p-values in the extracted table are presented differently, with comparisons between drugs (e.g., "LEV vs CBZ; 0.07 LEV vs VPA; 0.22"), while the baseline table lists p-values for each drug separately.
- The extracted table uses "Frequency" for the seizure response outcomes, while the baseline table uses "Percent".
- The order of the rows is different between the two tables.
- The baseline table has separate rows for each drug and outcome, while the extracted table groups the drugs together for each outcome.

Based on these similarities and differences, I would assign a similarity score of [[75]]. The tables contain mostly the same information, but there are some differences in the drugs included, the presentation of p-values, and the organization of the data. The missing "EEG response - responder" row for LEV in the extracted table also reduces the similarity score.

The tables have some similarities in structure, with both containing columns for Characteristic/risk factor, Exposure, Outcomes, Statistic, Value, Unit, Variability statistic, Variability value, Interval type, Lower limit, High limit, and P value. 

However, there are significant differences in the content:

1. The baseline table focuses on comparing outcomes between Methylprednisolone and Placebo exposures, while the extracted table does not specify any exposures and instead lists various patient characteristics and surgical factors.

2. The outcomes in the baseline table relate to STAT mortality risk categories, CPB duration, aortic cross clamp duration, use of DHCA, DHCA duration, and modified ultrafiltration. The extracted table covers a wider range of characteristics like gestational age, sex, race, ethnicity, specific congenital heart defects, age and weight at surgery, in addition to some of the surgical factors in the baseline table.

3. The statistics used are similar (frequency, mean) but the extracted table is missing % values for some frequency rows. 

4. Units are specified more consistently in the extracted table.

5. Variability statistics and values are provided in the extracted table but are mostly missing in the baseline table except for a few rows.

6. Interval type and limit columns are completely empty in the extracted table.

7. P-values are provided for some rows in the extracted table but are missing for many rows in the baseline table.

Given the significant differences in the specific exposures, outcomes and characteristics described, and the missing data across various columns in both tables, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[35]]

The tables have some high-level structural similarity but the detailed content being compared is quite different. The extracted table appears to be characterizing a single study cohort, while the baseline table is comparing two exposures (drug vs placebo) within a cohort.

Similarities:
- Both tables contain data on blood loss, need for uterotonic agents, hemoglobin levels, blood pressure, pulse rate, and drug side effects for a tranexamic acid (TXA) group and a control group.
- The values, units, and statistics (mean, SD, frequency, %) are generally consistent between the two tables for matching parameters.
- P-values are provided for most parameters in both tables.

Differences:
- The extracted table is missing several parameters compared to the baseline table, such as abortion rates, duration of third stage of labor, BP and PR before delivery, and Hb before delivery. This significantly reduces the similarity score.
- The extracted table combines the drug side effect data into fewer rows, while the baseline table has separate rows for each specific side effect and time period. This affects the granularity of the data.
- Some p-values in the extracted table are reported as ".000*" instead of a numerical value like in the baseline table.
- The order of the rows is different between the tables.

Based on the provided guidelines and the differences noted above, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[65]]

The score is significantly reduced from 100 due to the missing parameters in the extracted table compared to the baseline. The combining of side effect data into fewer rows and the differences in p-value reporting also contribute to a lower score. However, the core data that is present in both tables is generally consistent in terms of values, units, and statistics, which keeps the score from being even lower.

Similarities:
- Both tables contain information about exposure to quetiapine and outcomes related to infant development (motor and mental milestones/delays)
- The Exposure, Outcomes, Statistic, Value, and Unit columns have some matching or related content between the tables

Differences: 
- The extracted table contains many more rows of data (57 vs 2 in baseline) covering a much wider range of exposures, outcomes, and patient characteristics
- The extracted table has percentage values and variability statistics that are absent from the baseline
- Many of the outcomes in the extracted table (rash, sedation, diarrhea, etc.) are not present in the baseline
- The extracted table is missing p-values that are present in the baseline (though listed as NA)
- Some of the data in the extracted table does not match the expected column definitions (e.g. "Normal" and "Delay" listed as outcomes rather than values)

Given the significant differences in the number of data rows, range of drugs and outcomes covered, and presence of some misaligned data, I would assess the overall similarity of these tables as:

[[35]]

The tables have a small amount of overlapping information but the extracted data covers a much broader scope and does not consistently match the structure and content of the baseline table.

However, there are several key differences:

1. The extracted table is missing many of the rows and columns present in the baseline table. The baseline has data on changes in ophthalmic parameters after atropine treatment at baseline and 12 months, while the extracted table does not contain this information.

2. The extracted table has additional rows for age, gender, and iris color that are not present in the baseline table. 

3. The extracted table uses a "Residual" column instead of the "Variability statistic" and "Variability value" columns used in the baseline.

4. The baseline table provides mean values with standard deviations for the ophthalmic parameters, which are completely absent in the extracted table.

5. The units are specified in the baseline table but not the extracted table.

Given the significant amount of missing information and differences in row and column structure, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[35]]

The tables have some overlap in the risk factor odds ratios, but the extracted table is missing the majority of the information provided in the baseline table. Aligning the row and column structure and including the missing ophthalmic parameter data would be needed to increase the similarity score.

3. The extracted table includes more detailed breakdowns of the brain imaging scores (e.g., white matter score, cortical gray matter score, etc.) compared to the baseline table.

4. The statistics and values for the brain imaging scores are presented differently between the two tables. The extracted table uses median and interquartile range, while the baseline table uses adjusted relative risk and confidence intervals.

5. The p-values for the brain imaging scores are more frequently reported in the extracted table compared to the baseline table.

6. The exposure variable is described slightly differently between the tables ("Morphine exposure" vs "Exposure to morphine in the first 7 days of life").

7. Some of the outcome variables are worded differently between the tables, although they appear to be measuring similar constructs (e.g., "Tinning of the corpus callosum" vs "Thinning of the corpus callosum").

In summary, while there is some overlap in the brain imaging outcomes reported, the extracted table is missing a significant amount of the information present in the baseline table, and the presentation and analysis of the results differs between the tables. Therefore, the similarity score is relatively low at 65 out of 100.

Here are the key differences between the two tables:

1. The baseline table focuses on trachomatous inflammation prevalence in children exposed to azithromycin or placebo at baseline and 24 months. The extracted table provides demographic information about children in communities, such as age distribution, gender, and geographic characteristics.

2. The baseline table uses percent as the unit and 95% confidence interval for variability. The extracted table uses % per community for most values and reports standard deviation (SD) for variability.

3. The exposure and outcomes columns are populated in the baseline table but empty in the extracted table.

4. The extracted table has additional columns for characteristic/risk factor that are not present in the baseline table, such as age groups, gender, and geographic variables.

5. The baseline table includes a comparison of azithromycin vs. placebo using an incidence rate ratio, which is not found in the extracted table.

6. The p-value column is empty in both tables.

Given the significant differences in the types of data reported and the structure of the tables, the similarity score is quite low.

The tables have different focuses and report distinct types of data, with only a few common elements such as the inclusion of children and the reporting of percentages with variability. However, the specific outcomes, exposures, and characteristics differ substantially between the two tables.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

Similarity Score: [[65]]

Key Differences:
1. The extracted table contains many additional rows not present in the baseline table, covering additional exposures (dexamethasone, inhaled budesonide) and populations (infants <32 weeks and <27 weeks with and without postnatal steroids). The baseline table is limited to specific exposures in a single population.

2. The extracted table is missing some exposures that are in the baseline table, such as methyl-prednisolone.

3. The outcomes, statistics, and units are quite different between the two tables. The baseline focuses more on delivery characteristics and respiratory support, while the extracted table includes longer-term outcomes like length of stay, BPD, ROP, NEC, GI perforation, brain injury.

4. The baseline table adheres well to the specified column definitions, while the extracted table has some mismatches. For example, the "Interval type" column in the extracted table contains actual interval values rather than the type of interval. 

5. The extracted table has many blank cells, especially in the variability and interval columns. The baseline table has better data completeness.

6. Synonyms are used inconsistently between the tables, such as "Drugs for resuscitation at delivery" vs "Dugs for resuscitation at delivery".

In summary, while there is some overlap in the exposures and outcomes covered, the two tables have substantial differences in content, completeness, and adherence to the column definitions. The additional data in the extracted table is useful but the data quality issues reduce the overall similarity to the baseline. Significant data cleaning and standardization would be needed to make the tables more directly comparable.
